# DoubleClapDetectionGiga
double clap detect using condenser mic, comparator, external interrupt and a timer
--code for a ch32v203f6p6 microcontroller and the library( pretty sure my library is only combatable with ch32v203 due to the pin.h because different family has different pins for different peripherals)
